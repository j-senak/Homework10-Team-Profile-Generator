# Homework 10 Team Profile Generator
In this project, we are developing an application that generates a team's information in personal cards. The user will use the terminal to enter information into the prompts to generate the user's card.

## Why
I wanted an easy way to keep track of your project team's information. With these, a team member can get the information of any of his coworkers.

## The Process
I started with downloading the npm package dependacies I needed for this project like Inquirer and Jest. Then I built out the basic JavaScript in the app.js. In this, I wrote out the teminal prompts that saves the user's inputs. With that information, I built the files that have the child exports. I had trouble proceeding because my terminal was giving me errors that I could not resolve and I couldn't test the application.
